  - Tenant-aware log filtering and retrieval
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Automatic log buffering and batch processing
  - LGPD compliance tags and metadata

### 2. Medical Audit Service
**File:** `server/shared/medical-audit.service.ts`
- **Purpose:** LGPD/GDPR compliant medical data access tracking
- **Features:**
  - 18 different medical audit event types
  - Automatic before/after state capture
  - Risk level assessment (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - Compliance tag generation
  - Patient audit trail generation
  - Legal basis documentation

### 3. Smart Alerts Service
**File:** `server/shared/smart-alerts.service.ts`
- **Purpose:** Proactive monitoring with intelligent alerting
- **Features:**
  - 8 alert categories (Performance, Security, Cache, Database, etc.)
  - 4 severity levels with automatic escalation
  - Frequency limiting to prevent alert spam
  - Auto-resolution capabilities
  - Real-time monitoring of system health
  - Tenant-specific alert filtering

### 4. Observability API Routes
**File:** `server/api/v1/observability/observability.routes.ts`
- **Purpose:** RESTful API for accessing observability data
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/v1/observability/health` - System health check
  - `GET /api/v1/observability/metrics` - Performance metrics
  - `GET /api/v1/observability/logs` - Filtered logs by tenant
  - `GET /api/v1/observability/audit/:patient_id` - Patient audit trail
  - `GET /api/v1/observability/alerts` - Active alerts
  - `POST /api/v1/observability/alerts/:id/resolve` - Manual alert resolution
  - `GET /api/v1/observability/compliance/report` - Compliance reporting

### 5. Automatic Logging Middleware
**File:** `server/shared/observability-middleware.ts`
- **Purpose:** Automatic request/response logging and auditing
- **Features:**
  - Request correlation tracking with unique IDs
  - Automatic medical data access auditing
  - Security event logging
  - Performance monitoring for slow requests
  - LGPD compliance tracking for data privacy operations
  - Comprehensive error tracking with context

## Integration Points

### Server Application Integration
- Middleware chain properly configured in `server/index.ts`
- Order: Correlation → Observability → Medical Compliance → Cache → Tenant Isolation
- Global error handler replaced with observability-aware error tracking

### API Router Integration
- Observability routes integrated into main API router
- Mounted at `/api/v1/observability` namespace
- Authentication required for all observability endpoints

## Medical Compliance Features

### LGPD/GDPR Compliance
- Automatic audit trail for all medical data access
- Legal basis documentation for each access type
- Before/after state capture for data modifications
- Comprehensive compliance reporting
- Data privacy operation tracking

### Audit Events Tracked
1. **Patient Data:** View, Create, Update, Delete, Export
2. **Medical Records:** View, Create, Update, Delete, Print, Share
3. **Appointments:** View, Create, Update, Cancel, Complete
4. **Access Control:** Permission Grant/Revoke, Access Denied
5. **Data Privacy:** Export, Anonymize, Delete, GDPR Requests

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collected
- API response times (average, P95, P99)
- Request volumes per tenant
- Error rates and patterns
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Database query performance
- System resource utilization

### Alert Triggers
- High response times (>500ms)
- Low cache hit rates (<70%)
- High error rates (>5%)
- Multiple authentication failures (≥5)
- Cross-tenant access attempts
- Database connection issues

## Security Monitoring

### Security Events Logged
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Cross-tenant access violations
- Permission changes
- Data export operations
- Suspicious access patterns

### Automatic Response
- Critical alerts for security violations
- Immediate logging of security events
- Tenant isolation breach detection
- IP address and user agent tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Aware
- All logging and monitoring respects tenant boundaries
- Tenant-specific metric collection
- Filtered data access based on current clinic context
- Automatic clinic_id injection in all audit events

### Scalable Design
- Asynchronous log processing with batching
- Memory-efficient alert management
- Configurable monitoring intervals
- Auto-cleanup of old data
- Frequency limiting to prevent system overload

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when observability services fail
- No impact on core application functionality
- Comprehensive error logging for observability components
- Safe fallbacks for all monitoring operations

## Data Flow

1. **Request Initiated** → Correlation ID generated
2. **Observability Middleware** → Request logged, metrics collected
3. **Medical Compliance Check** → Audit events generated if medical data accessed
4. **Core Application Logic** → Business logic executes
5. **Response Generated** → Response metrics collected, completion logged
6. **Smart Alerts** → Background monitoring analyzes patterns
7. **Audit Processing** → Medical audit events processed and stored
8. **Log Aggregation** → Structured logs batched and stored

## Deployment Status
